Howdy! I'm Alizain. I'm 24 and a site reliability-software engineer (sre-swe) at JPMorganChase from Houston, TX. I hold bachelor's degrees in computer science and mathematics. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, with a focus on systems and artificial intelligence.
