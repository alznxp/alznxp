Howdy! I'm Alizain. I'm 23 and a site reliability-software engineer (sre-swe) at JPMorganChase from Houston, TX. I hold bachelor's degrees in Computer Science & Mathematics. I'm currently pursuing a master of science in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin with a focus in systems and artificial intelligence.
