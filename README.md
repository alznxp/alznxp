Howdy! I'm Alizain. I'm 23 and a site reliability-software engineer (sre-swe) at JPMorganChase from Houston, TX. I hold dual Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin, with a focus on systems and artificial intelligence.
